///The new category property is the Category to display that the grid will pass in. The new function, recipes(for:), was created to filter recipes by category. Then, the recipes property calls this function to return the recipes filtered by the category. The navigation title was also changed to only include the specific category. Lastly, RecipesListView_Previews needed to add the category argument for RecipesListView as well as an environment object to correctly display a list of recipes.
