/// recipe is wrapped with @Binding which means this view does not own it.
/// RecipesListView will provide the recipe to ModifyRecipeView through the binding. The binding allows ModifyRecipeView to access and modify the original property as if it owned recipe. Once ModifyRecipeView is done, it doesnâ€™t need to send any recipe data back to RecipesListView since it was already owned by RecipesListView.
